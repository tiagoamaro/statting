<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Stating is a small weekend project that aims getting a better user interactivity with CoinShift data.
</p>

<p>
To start querying your data, fill in the "BTC Address" field, and click on search. After that, Statting will pool your info from CoinShift in a 5 minute interval.
</p>

<p>
Statting store the address data for a better user visualization of its history and statistics. Please note that this project is not responsible for any data loss.

<h2>Work in Progress (Todo list)</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Development</h2>
